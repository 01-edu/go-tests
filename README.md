# go-tests

To run the tests make sure the two repositories are right next to each other:

- https://github.com/01-edu/piscine-go
- https://github.com/01-edu/go-tests

To test an exercise, run this command in the `go-tests` folder:

```
./test_one.sh isnegative
```

To run all the exercises, run this command in the `go-tests` folder:

```
./test_all.sh
```
